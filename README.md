# authonice demo (nodejs & mithril)

## IN PROGRESS: not ready, yet

This is the demo of [authonice](http://authonice.github.io) with [backend for nodejs](https://github.com/authonice/back-node) & a [mithril frontend](https://github.com/authonice/front-mithril).

[authonice](http://authonice.github.io) is a platform/language/framework agnostic ecosystem for web-app authentication, with lots of inspiration from [satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer).

It's designed to work with lots of [backend languages](http://authonice.github.io/backends), [auth services](http://authonice.github.io/services), & [frontend frameworks](http://authonice.github.io/frontends). It's goal is to make you super-happy because your sites are safe, easy to setup & maintain, and stylishly locked-down in your language/frameworks of choice.

If we don't have a module for the frontend-framework/backend-language/auth-service you want to support, [ask us](https://github.com/authonice/authonice.github.io/issues/new?title=Request:%20&labels=request) or [contribute](http://authonice.github.io/contribute)!
